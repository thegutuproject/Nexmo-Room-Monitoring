# Nexmo-Room-Monitoring

Hey!

The primary purpose of this project was to open the door to Computer Vision and test it out, and Im ust say, its been a great success.

This project will use an attached webcam and begin monitoring the room or area you set it for. If it detects any motion, itll take the frame that triggered it, and upload it to Imgur. Afterwards, it texts you a picture of the image so you can check it whereever you are.
